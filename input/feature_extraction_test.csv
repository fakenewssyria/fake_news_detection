1923848269,Syria regime raids on Aleppo kill 16 civilians Monitor,"Syria regime raids on Aleppo kill 16 civilians Monitor AFP Sunday 5 Jun 2016 Dozens of Syrian regime strikes on Aleppo killed at least 16 civilians on Sunday a monitor said and caused huge damage to one rebel-held district targeted by a barrel bomb. The crude unguided explosive device hit the Qaterji neighbourhood where an AFP photographer saw a street strewn with rubble as residents ran for safety and a rescuer rushed a bloodied child into an ambulance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others including a child were killed in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily ""There are only civilians here there are no rebels!"" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. Around 200000 people lived in eastern parts of Aleppo held by the rebels and the only route out of those areas has been cut following fierce fighting that erupted on Thursday. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids.

1923848200,Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown,"Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown AFP Sunday 22 Feb 2015 A suicide bomber killed four people in a hospital on Sunday in an attack that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person"" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. ""Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province - where the town is located - has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile the Observatory said 10 children and 13 rebels were among 48 people executed by government forces in the northern village of Rityan earlier this week. The killings took place after troops entered the town Tuesday during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border. Abdel Rahman said all the dead were from six families. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family."" The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive this week to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged Shiite villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The heavy fighting claimed the lives of 129 loyalists and 116 rebels including an Al-Nusra commander according to an Observatory toll. While the ground offensive failed warplanes kept pounding rebel areas of Aleppo city and other parts of the country. On Saturday two women and two children were among eight people killed when a barrel bomb hit a building in an opposition-held area of Aleppo city once Syrias commercial capital. Six people were also reported killed in rebel shelling of regime-held areas of the city. The air force also killed at least 10 people in rebel areas east of Damascus Saturday the Observatory said. According to the group they were the latest of more than 7000 people killed across Syria since the UN Security Council passed a resolution last year ordering an end to sieges and indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas. The Observatory ""has documented the killing of 5812 civilians including 1733 children 969 women and 3110 men in barrel bombings and (other) air raids"" over the past year. Meanwhile rebel fire on regime-held areas killed 1102 people said the Observatory adding that 234 of them were children. And 313 people died in areas under army siege in the past year as a result of food and medical shortages despite the fact that the resolution also ordered the lifting of sieges.",ahram,against,0,1,0.311004785,0.002392344,0.004784689,0.002392344,0.043062201,0.028708134,0.226926306,1
1924058169,Regime Russia air strikes kill 39 in Idlib as strikes continue to pound Road of death to Aleppo,"Published June 12 2016 At least 39 people were killed and dozens were injured in airstrikes launched by the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes in Syrias western province of Idlib on Sunday. A Syrian regime warplane struck a marketplace in the opposition-held province local civil defense official Leys al-Faris told Anadolu Agency. ""At least 36 people were killed and 50 others injured in the attack"" he said. Al-Faris described the attack as a ""massacre"" committed by the Bashar Assad regime during the fasting month of Ramadan which began in Syria last week. He said rescuers were struggling to extract people from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Meanwhile three people were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the city of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib. ""Rescuers are looking for survivors following the attack"" al-Faris said. Since April 21 Syrian regime forces and Russian warplanes have intensified attacks on opposition-held areas in Syria killings scores of civilians. This comes as the opposition-held sector of Syrias divided city of Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world in recent days by an escalation of air and artillery strikes on the only road in putting hundreds of thousands of people under effective siege. A regime campaign to fully capture Aleppo would most likely bury what little hope remains of reviving a diplomatic effort to end the five-year-old civil war after talks and a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia fell apart earlier this year. Aleppo Syrias largest city before the war when it had more than 2 million people has been divided for years into opposition and government sectors and capturing all of it has been one of Bashar Assads biggest goals. An estimated 350000 people are still thought to live in the opposition sector in harsh conditions made worse by the latest attempt to besiege them by cutting off the last remaining route out the Castello Road named for Aleppos old castle. ""The regime was not able to cut the road by land so it has decided to keep the planes in the sky continuously hitting everything that passes regardless of what it is"" said Zakaria Malahifji senior official in the Aleppo opposition group Fastaqim. ""Whoever wants to go on the Castello road is undertaking a suicide mission"" he said. ""Its been this way for 10 or 12 days. The situation was difficult before - it was targeted and people were crossing with difficulty - but now it is almost cut nobody dares to use it"" he said speaking at his groups office in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. The international focus in Syria in recent weeks has partly turned towards the conflict with Islamic State fighters as both the government and its enemies have made gains at the expense of the ultra-hardline Islamist militants on several fronts. But the separate hope of foreign powers - that the wider civil war could also be resolved - has broken down with Aleppo potentially the biggest battlefield of all. Hundreds of people have been killed there since peace talks broke off. Assad vowed in a speech last week to recapture ""every inch"" of Syria. Aleppo he said would be a ""graveyard"" for the ambitions of his regional foe Turkish President Tayyip Erdoan who has backed opposition groups. A pro-Damascus source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the reference was a signal of his intentions ""Why this threat? Because there are preparations for something big in Aleppo."" So far pro-regime ground forces aided by Iranian and Lebanese Shiite militias have been unable to complete the encirclement of Aleppo by capturing a narrow corridor of territory through which the Castello Road passes. The highway had long been under sniper fire but attacks from the air and artillery sharply increased less than two weeks ago with more planes flying and new rockets and guns moved into range. ""Castello is the road to death to Aleppo. I did not know whether I would make it to Aleppo city alive"" said Mohamad Adeeb an opposition activist who drove the road on Friday. ""I saw death with my own eyes with corpses lying on the way and dozens of trucks and civilian cars and bodies that none of the civil defence teams were able to recover because of the intensity of the shelling of the regime and Russian warplanes."" Inside Aleppo the new pressure on the road has driven up prices of goods adding to the suffering of those still there. The Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights says more than 300 people have been killed in air strikes and government bombardment of opposition-held Aleppo since April. Opposition sources say the toll is much higher with dozens of people currently being killed each day in eastern Aleppo one of the bloodiest spells it has suffered in the conflict. Civil defence emergency workers operating in opposition-held areas say more than 450 people were killed there in the last month. ""It is a difficult and dangerous period we are going through. Aleppo is almost under siege"" Abu Yassine said. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN.

Fighters from the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda al-Nusra Front were also killed said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has been attempting to seize al-Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the province and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian war planes have been battling for control of al-Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo.

1926479161,Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib,Monday 15 February 2016 Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib. A hospital supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the town of Maaret al-Nouman in rural Idlib was hit earlier today by Russian air airstrikes. At least seven people were killed and many more wounded in the deliberate attack on the hospital. The hospital was completely destroyed and the fate of at least eight members of staff is still unknown. The Syrian Coalition condemned the attack saying it is not the first hospital to be targeted by Russian warplanes. Russia has targeted civilian neighborhoods medical centers schools and houses of worship. This crime will not be the last as long as the international community keeps silent and shirks its responsibility to respond to them. While we hold Moscow fully responsible for these crimes we warn that the international communitys continued inaction serves as an incentive for Russia to commit more crimes in Syria. Russias acts in Syria will not only negatively affect the political process but will also encourage the spread of terrorism the Syrian Coalition stressed. The Syrian Coalition called upon the ceasefire task force formed as part of the Munich agreement not to ignore the horrible crimes Russia continues to commit against the Syrian people. These crimes would undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement to the conflict. The continued silence over Russias behavior in Syria undoubtedly represents complicity in these crimes and would ruin what has been achieved in Munich the Coalition said. These ongoing crimes especially after the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2254 and the signing off on the Munich agreement undermine all chances of restoring trust in the international community. They cast doubt about the international communitys ability to find a real political solution to end the tragedy unfolding in Syria the Coalition added.

1926479150,Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province,Tuesday 14 November 2017 Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemns the brutal crime which was committed by aircraft of the Russian occupation forces in the town of Atareb in western rural Aleppo on Monday November 13. Initial reports indicated that over 40 civilians were killed and hundreds more were injured when Russian jets fired vacuum missiles on a popular market in the town. Russia which has used every possible means to undermine the will of the Syrian people and impose devious schemes and projects on them continues to wriggle out of its commitments and obligations towards the de-escalation zones agreement. Instead of honoring its role as a so-called guarantor of the agreement Russia bombed a popular market that was full of civilians in the town of Atareb in broad daylight destroying dozens of houses and buildings though no rebel groups were stationed in the town which is under the authority of a civilian council and a local police force. Instead of changing its positions and exerting pressure on the Assad regime to force it to seriously participate in the Geneva process and abide by UN Security Council resolutions and engage in direct and serious negotiations this crime one again demonstrated that Russia is unwilling to change its stance. The crime has also proved that Russia is determined to side with the Assad regime; continue with the war crimes Against the Syrian people; and that it is not interested in stopping its crime nor forcing its allies to stop the crimes they are committing against the Syrian people. The Syrian Coalition holds Russia directly and fully responsible for the war crimes it has committed in Syria since the beginning of its direct military intervention in Syria as well as for the crimes of genocide and the Assad regimes use of chemical weapons and other internationally prohibited weapons. The Coalition calls on the UN Security Council to condemn this massacre and its perpetrators as well as to prosecute them by all possible means as war criminals and to take serious action to protect Syrian civilians from these continued massacres.

Another 100 people were wounded in Karam al-Luz in attacks SANA blamed on ""terrorists"" the governments term for people fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. ""Twenty-five people fell as martyrs including women and children and more than 107 others were wounded after the explosion of the two car bombs"" a half-hour apart SANA said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombings killed 21 people in a mostly Alawite neighbourhood referring to the Shiite Muslim offshoot sect to which the Assad family belongs. Videos posted online by activists showed destroyed shopfronts and people panicking and running in all directions as rescuers struggled to extinguish a fire. Syrias uprising began as a series of peaceful protests against the Assad familys four-decade rule but escalated into a full-scale insurgency after the regime launched a devastating crackdown on dissent. More than 150000 people have been killed since the revolt began in March 2011 and nine million have been driven from their homes including 2.6 million international refugees. Homs was an epicentre of the revolt but is now almost entirely in regime hands with small pockets of rebels holding out in besieged areas in and around the devastated Old City. Earlier Wednesday troops fighting in the Qalamun region seized the town of Rankus tightening their grip on the strategic region along the Lebanese border. ""Units of the Syrian army have now accomplished their operation in the Rankus area and restored security and stability after eliminating a large number of terrorists"" state media said.

The group with a network of sources inside Syria said 28 rebels had been killed in Qalamun area as well as in Eastern Ghouta elsewhere in Damascus province in fighting between Tuesday and Wednesday. Troops backed by pro-regime militiamen and Lebanons Shiite movement Hezbollah have captured most of Qalamun through which a key highway runs between Damascus and Homs.

He added that Tal Hamis situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group. Tuesdays bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market. ""Some of the bodies were so mutilated by the strikes that people couldnt tell the human from the animal remains"" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier Tuesday the Observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa according to the group which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports. Both towns are under jihadist control though all of Tuesdays casualties there were civilians. Most of Idlibs countryside is out of government control but its capital remains in regime hands.

Russias actions however will not weaken the resolve of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition to reclaim freedom and dignity and build a civil state based on inclusivity and the rule of law he stressed. Nyrabiya called on all rebel and FSA groups to reconsider their strategies and lend an ear to calls for them to pull out of Idlib and assign the task of managing the affairs in the city to the local council and the free police forces. The intensified Russian airstrikes on Idlib prompted an exodus of civilians towards the surrounding cities towns and farmlands. Secondary education exams were also postponed as a result of the airstrikes and Friday prayers cancelled in all of the citys mosques.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear whether the strikes on rebel-held Atareb had been carried out by Syrian warplanes or those of Damascuss ally Russia. The monitor said three strikes hit the towns market adding that the overall toll was expected to rise because dozens of people had been wounded or were still missing after the attack. A photographer contributing to AFP saw massive destruction at the scene with rubble from damaged buildings covering the street and panicked civilians carrying away the injured. Three men helped one of those hit in the attack his face drenched in blood and his features almost completely obscured. Nearby the body of a man in a blue shirt and dark trousers lay where he had died. Civil defence workers rushed alongside civilians to evacuate the injured with one man in a thick beanie hat carrying a wailing child in a pink sweater away from the scene. Elsewhere the bodies of at least three children were laid out on the ground partly covered by thick bolts of fabric. Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed under a deal earlier this year between Syrias allies Russia and Iran and rebel backer Turkey.

1926479261,Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo.,Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

1924058039,Dozens dead as warplanes pound rebel-held north Syria | Jordan Times,Last updated at Aug 142016 BEIRUT Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian rebel forces advanced into a key regime-held district in Aleppo on Monday to reopen the last remaining supply route into opposition-held districts. The offensive to gain control of the strategic Castello Road in the Al Mallah district came at dawn just days after the area was encircled by regime forces. Control over the Castello Road is the only way that some 250000 besieged residents of east Aleppo can have access to essentials like food and fuel. The regimes capture of the district days ago had come during an extension of a nationwide truce declared last week by the regime to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr.

1924058146,Airstrikes in northern and eastern Syria kill 20 civilians activists,"Published April 18 2017 An overnight airstrike likely carried out by the U.S.-led coalition struck an eastern Syrian town held by the Daesh killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens opposition activists said. Another airstrike this one during the day hit a opposition-held village in the northwest on Tuesday killing a woman and nine children. The activists said the late Monday strike on the town of Boukamal on the Iraqi border was similar to airstrikes carried out by the U.S.-led coalition that has been targeting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition have killed dozens of civilians over the past several weeks as the battle against the extremists intensifies. The new purported took place as the U.S.-led coalition came under fire from Human Rights Watch over another deadly incident in northern Syria last month in which dozens of people were killed. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency said the strike of Boukamal killed six people and wounded 15 all of them women and children. It did not say whether any Daesh fighters were also killed. The U.S. militarys regional command CENTCOM said in response to a query by The Associated Press that it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Activists gave different casualty tolls. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Boukamal strike killed 15 civilians including women and children as well as three Iraqi Daesh fighters. Opposition activist Omar Abu Laila who currently lives in Europe but is from the province where the strike took place and maintains contacts there said 10 people were killed including an Iraqi family of four. He said Daesh cordoned off the area and cut all telecommunications after the strike which heavily damaged at least four buildings. ""The number of casualties is huge"" Abu Laila said adding that mosque loudspeakers were used to urge people to head to hospitals to donate blood. Daesh used to control wide parts of Syria and Iraq where the group declared a caliphate in 2014. Over the past year the extremists have suffered a string of defeats at the hands of an array of Syrian and Iraqi forces. On Tuesday in northern Syria an airstrike on the village of Maaret Harmeh killed 10 people and wounded several others activists said. The Observatory said those killed were all relatives. The Civil Defense another activist group said 10 people were also wounded in that attack. Maaret Harmeh is close to the town of Khan Sheikhoun where a chemical weapons attack killed nearly 90 people on April 4. The United States has accused the Assad regime of being behind the attack and fired missiles at a Syrian army base. Syria denies the charges. Meanwhile Human Rights Watch said in a report Tuesday that U.S. forces appear to have failed to take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties in a March 16 airstrike that killed dozens of people in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo. U.S. officials said at the time that the airstrike hit an al-Qaida gathering killing dozens of militants. Syrian opposition activists said around 40 people mostly civilians were killed in the crowded Omar Ibn al-Khattab Mosque in the Jeeneh district. U.S. officials at the time also said they found no basis for reports that civilians were killed. However Human Rights Watchs 16-page report said it found no evidence to support the allegation that members of al-Qaida or any other armed group were meeting in the mosque. It said a religious lecture was being held at the time of the attack and that prayers were about to begin. ""The U.S. seems to have gotten several things fundamentally wrong in this attack and dozens of civilians paid the price"" said Ole Solvang HRW deputy emergencies director. ""The U.S. authorities need to figure out what went wrong start doing their homework before they launch attacks and make sure it doesnt happen again."" Lama Fakih the New York-based watchdogs deputy for Mideast and North Africa told the AP that the report concluded the mosque strike killed at least 38 people.

""Two of Belgiums F-16s were identified at that time in the region"" it said late Tuesday. ""There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region."" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the countrys air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements ""strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians"". ""I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN"" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

(TRT World and Agencies) Air strikes have struck Syrias town of Urum al-Joz in rebel-controlled Idlib province on Saturday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Civil Defence rescue service. The attack believed to have been carried out by Russian aircraft killed at least 18 people including five children said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise it added. The Civil Defence service said that the two air raids on the town on Saturday afternoon have killed 19 and wounded 22. Pressure mounts on Assad Turkey remains committed to a ceasefire in Syria but Russia must stop insisting that Bashar al Assad should remain in office Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday. Cavusoglu also said he told his Russian counterpart that Moscow did not take the necessary steps in the face of breaches in the Syrian ceasefire. Meanwhile Iraqs influential Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr also called on the regimes leader to step down and spare his country further bloodshed. Sadr who commands a large following among the urban poor of Baghdad and the southern cities is the first Iraqi Shia political leader to urge Assad to step down. Defeating Daesh The top priority for the United States in Syria is to defeat Daesh Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a TV interview on Sunday. ""Once Daesh threat has been reduced or eliminated I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilising the situation in Syria"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson cancelled a visit to Moscow scheduled for April 10 after the poison gas attack in Syria. The decision by Johnson to cancel the visit to Moscow later this month shows a lack of understanding of events in Syria Russias Foreign Ministry said on Sunday. The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian backers have vowed to keep up the fight against ""terrorists"" despite threats of further US strikes against the regime following the chemical attack. The US launched a cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base in response to the attack on Friday. Scores of people died and many were injured on Tuesday after the regime air strike dropped chemical bombs onto the town of Khan Shaykhun. But the regime has denied any responsibility saying its air strikes hit a rebel depot containing chemical materials.

1923102826,Scores of Syrian rebels killed over key Aleppo road,"Date of publication 10 July 2016 At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed during a major counter-offensive to recapture a critical supply route into Aleppo and break regime siege of the city which threatens 300000 civilians. Tags Castello road Syria Syrian regime UN siege Aleppo al-Nusra Front Ahrar al-Sham At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed in clashes with regime troops overnight during a failed bid to reopen the oppositions key supply route into Aleppo city. The fighters from the Faylaq al-Sham Islamist faction and al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front were killed trying to reopen the Castello Road which regime forces effectively severed on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The road was the only remaining supply route into the opposition-held east of Aleppo city which has been divided between government and rebel control since mid-2012. Government forces effectively severed the route on Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the Castello Road. The Observatory said there were deaths among government forces in the overnight fighting but had no immediate toll. ""The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed"" said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. Civilians face food shortages Syrian rebel forces are preparing for a major battle in Aleppo [Anadolu] Residents in Aleppo described shortages of basic goods after government troops advanced within firing range of the key Castello Road supply route. ""For two days the situation was calm I went to the market and I filled up my motorbike with gasoline. Today I couldnt even find a single tomato"" said Bilal Qaterji a local textile factory employee. ""Theres not a drop of fuel left because the Castello Road has been cut"" he told AFP. Residents in eastern Aleppo said they feared ongoing shortages if the Castello Road remained closed. ""I worry that the Castello Road will be cut for a long time it will lead to shortages of bread and other necessities"" said Ahmed Kanjou an unemployed father of four. Residents said prices were already rising and many were bracing for the possibility of a lengthy siege. Syrias government has been accused of using siege tactics to pressure rebel forces and the UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the method. Activists and rights groups including Doctors Without Borders [MSF] have reported deaths from starvation in some besieged areas. The Castello Road wraps around Aleppos eastern and northern edges and leads into rebel-controlled territory north of the battered city. President Bashar al-Assads forces have been trying to cut the route for more than two years and their Thursday advance brought them the closest so far to achieving that goal.

(Reuters Photo) Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.,dailysabah,against,0.010309278,1,0.31443299,0.00257732,0,0.007731959,0.051546392,0.036082474,0.635672416,1

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least six children were among those killed in nearly 40 air raids on parts of Eastern Ghouta in Damascus province. The Britain-based group said at least 140 people were wounded adding that government forces had also fired surface-to-surface missiles at the area. The assault came after rebels fired at least 70 rockets and mortar rounds at the capital killing seven people including a policeman. The barrage left usually busy parts of the city deserted. ""Within minutes our busy street was empty"" said a resident of the Baramkeh neighbourhood adding that the headteacher of a local school had been forced to take her students to a shelter. The middle class district is home to several university buildings as well as the headquarters of state news agency SANA. In the city centre traffic was light and many people stayed home from work. Rebel group Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam) warned two days ago that it would launch a barrage of missiles at the capital in response to deadly air strikes on rebel-held Douma in Eastern Ghouta. Its leader Zahran Alloush said Damascus was now considered a ""military zone"" and a target for the rebels. The group has carried out such barrages before including on January 25 when it fired dozens of rockets after a similar warning killing six. In Douma the government air strikes brought chaos with an AFP photographer reporting civilians streaming into a makeshift clinic. Medics overwhelmed by the number of arrivals were forced to treat some on the floor. Among them was an infant his red and white striped sweater lifted up to allow medics to apply a defibrillator to his bloodied chest. Eastern Ghouta is a key rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus and has been under siege for nearly two years. Since mid-2012 the government has conducted frequent air raids on rebel-held areas.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on Al-Shaara a town held by the Islamic State (IS) group in Deir Ezzor province were suspected to have been carried out by either Russian or Syrian government planes. The death toll is likely to rise due to the serious condition of some of the wounded Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Residents from nearby villages typically flock to the Al-Shaara market to do their shopping Abdel Rahman said. Heavy air strikes hit IS group -held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Ezzor from early Monday he said. IS controls more than 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the oil-rich province of the same name most of which has been in its hands since 2013. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year-old conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved.

The UN Childrens agency (UNICEF) said on Thursday that airstrikes targeting a school in Syrias rebel-held northern Idlib province early on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began nearly six years ago. Both first responders the Syrian Civil Defence and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have reported that 35 people were killed by the attack which struck a school complex in the village of Hass around midday on Wednesday as children gathered outside preparing to return home. Among the dead were 22 children. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake has called the airstrikes an ""outrage"" tantamount to a war crime."" The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets have said that the attack constituted a double tap. This occurs when a warplane carries out an initial bombing raid on a target and then waits for either signs of survivors or rescue workers to arrive before executing a second or more consequent attacks. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" said a local activist speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year. In the last week as Syrian and Russian airstrikes over Aleppo have temporarily calmed amid a Russian-proposed humanitarian pause in the city airstrikes on rebel positions have increased in Idlib as the Syrian regime seeks to stymie opposition gains in the province. Seven days of airstrikes across the northwestern province had left more than 75 civilians dead and another 150 wounded according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

1926479281,Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies,October 5 2017 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies. Stephanie Nebehay. Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals schools and people fleeing violence have been targeted by direct air strikes that may amount to war crimes the United Nations said without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants. September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa where 8000 people remain trapped and at least 149 people mostly women and children in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syrias northwest in the last 12 days of September he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama Aleppo and Deir al-Zor Moumtzis said again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days. We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals schools civilian infrastructure being targeted Robert Mardini ICRC regional director for the Middle East told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office. And of course this is outrageous unacceptable he said adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the de-escalation areas including Idlib rural Hama and eastern Ghouta. Taken together these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016 it said. Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure Mardini said. We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure. Syrias six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assads government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions some Western-backed and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River opposition activists former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid. The point here is not to point fingers Mardini said declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes.

At least 50 ISIL terrorists have been killed in the past 24 hours in clashes suicide bombings and US-led air strikes in Syrias Kobani a monitor said Sunday. The opposing UK-based Syrian Observatory said the number of deaths was one of the highest daily tolls for the terrorist group since it launched an assault on the strategic town on the Turkish border in September. The monitoring group said at least five of those killed were suicide bomb attackers two of them involved in attacks on the border crossing that separates Kobani from Turkey. Another 11 were killed in clashes that ensued between Kobanis Kurdish defenders and the jihadists at the border after the bombings but there was no breakdown for the remaining toll. The group also said 11 Kurdish fighters were killed in the same period in Kobani along with one Syrian rebel fighter backing the Kurdish forces. ISIL began advancing on Kobani on September 16 hoping to quickly seize the small border town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border. At one point it looked set to overrun the town but Kurdish Syrian fighters backed by US-led coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces have held back the group. For now the town remains roughly evenly divided between ISIL and Kurdish control.,manar,pro,0.041176471,1,0.376470588,0,0,0,0.047058824,0.035294118,0.048149534,0

(TRT World and Agencies) At least four people died and many suffered breathing difficulties when gas believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo on Wednesday a hospital and a civil defence group said. Hamza Khatib the manager of Al-Quds hospital in Aleppo told a Reuters photographer the hospital had recorded four deaths from gas poisoning and 55 injuries. Seven people were still receiving hospital treatment. Khatib said he was preserving pieces of patients clothing and fragments from the barrel bombs as evidence for analysis. Syria Civil Defence a Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said it had recorded three deaths and 22 injuries after a barrel containing a gas suspected of being chlorine fell on the Zubdiya neighbourhood of rebel-held Aleppo. Civilians brought to the Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a war monitor said helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al Dawla and Zubdiya leading to the death of a woman and her child from suffocation. The northern city of Aleppo Syrias most populous before the war is split into rebel- and regime-held districts. Capturing the whole city would be a major prize for Syrias Bashar al-Assad in the countrys five-year-old conflict. A fierce battle for control of the city broke out on Friday when rebels staged a major assault to break through a month-long regime siege of the citys rebel-held east where about 300000 people are thought to be living. Fighters managed to pierce the ring of regime-controlled territory but a safe corridor for civilians and aid has not yet been established. There have been unconfirmed reports among activists and residents of chlorine gas falling on rebel-held east Aleppo since the rebel offensive. The Aleppo Media Centre an online opposition news portal for the city posted a video that it said was of victims of the gas attack a child and adults wearing breathing apparatus. Two men interviewed said barrel bombs were dropped and there was a strong smell of gas. People then began to suffer breathing and eye problems. A boy breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) Western powers say the Syrian regime has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government has accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian regime agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulphur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.

Army sources in Syria said on Sunday that the US pounded several strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor in the last few days to prevent the army and its allies further advances in the fight against the ISIL terrorists. ""The US aimed to extend the geographical area of its influence by bombing the strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor and stop the Syrian armys advance in the war against the ISIL"" the source told FNA. ""Washington also sought to cut the supply routes between the provinces and separate Deir Ezzors countryside from the city of Deir Ezzor through the bombing"" the source added. ""Destruction of Deir Ezzor bridges was also aimed at dividing the regions under the US and Russian influence in the Eastern and Western parts of the Euphrates"" the source said. The US-led coalition fighter jets once again conducted air raids over Deir Ezzor province on Friday destroying two other key bridges over the Euphrates River just three days after demolishing two other strategic bridges in similar airstrikes in the same region near the border with Iraq. According to reports the Coalitions airstrikes resulted in the destruction of al-Shihan Bridge near al-Salhin neighborhood in al-Bu Kamal countryside and Tarif Bridge in the Western countryside that extends between Deir Ezzor and Raqqa provinces.

The bombers had also targeted the Syrian army troops near the city of Deir Ezzor on September 17 leaving over 90 military personnel dead and a hundred wounded. Russias Defense Ministry confirmed a report by the Syrian state news agency that an ISIS offensive began right after Syrian Army positions were hit by the bombers of the US-led coalition. The actions of the coalition clearly paved the way for ISIL terrorists to attack the position and take control of it the agency said citing the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces. The General Command called the bombing a serious and blatant aggression against Syrian forces and said it was ""conclusive evidence"" that the US and its allies support ISIL terrorist group. A day later a military source disclosed that the ISIS launched attacks on the Syrian army positions in Deir Ezzor only 7 minutes after the US-led coalitions airstrikes. The military source reiterated that the air and ground assault were highly coordinated. A Syrian top official said the countrys intelligence unit possesses an audio recording of a conversation between the ISIL group and the US military before the airstrikes by the US-led coalition on the Syrian army troops near Deir Ezzor on September 17.

The army and the Kurds have coordinated on security against ISIL in surrounding Hasakeh province but tensions have built up between the sometimes-rival authorities. The army and its ally the National Defense Forces control Qamishli airport and parts of the city as well as areas of the provincial capital Hasakeh to the south. Nearly all of the rest of the province is controlled by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) who have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they control. ,manar,pro,0.007462687,1,0.268656716,0.007462687,0,0.007462687,0.029850746,0.029850746,0.070873049,1

1924058064,Syria air strikes kill 22 mostly children outside school | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 262016 BEIRUT Air strikes in Syria killed up to 22 people mostly children on Wednesday when warplanes struck a residential area housing a school complex in the northern rebel-held province of Idlib activists and rescue workers said. A team of first responders the Syrian Civil Defence in Idlib said 22 people were killed and at least 50 wounded in the raids on the village of Hass. Most of those killed were children the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave the same death toll and said 14 children and a woman were among those killed. The activist-operated Idlib News network which gave a lower toll of 17 people killed said the strikes hit as the children were gathered outside the school complex. It said the death toll could rise as some of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition the network added. Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold though radical groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the US-led coalition targeting Daesh militants. Footage posted by activists online shows a huge plume of smoke rising from the area of the strikes and rescuers rushing casualties away along a dusty road lined with destroyed buildings. A womans body is seen being carried on a stretcher while other bodies covered in cloth and one with only a hat lie under shrubs and other casualties are ferried away in pick-up trucks. An activist at the scene Muaz Al Shami said as many as 10 air strikes were believed to have hit the residential area. The video content couldnt be independently confirmed. However it conforms with AP reporting on the events depicted. Earlier in the day the northern Aleppo province saw a new escalation as a helicopter believed to belong to Syrian government forces dropped barrel bombs in a deadly attack on Turkey-backed opposition forces in the border area Turkish officials said. A statement attributed to the field commander of Syrias pro-government troops said any Turkish advances in northern Syria under the pretext of fighting Daesh militants would be dealt with forcefully and appropriately. The barrel bombing was said to have occurred in the village of Tal Madiq in a part of northern Aleppo where rival groups have been operating mostly to rout Daesh militants. If confirmed it would be the first attack by Syrian government forces on the Turkish-backed fighters. Turkeys state-run news agency didnt say when the attack occurred and said at least two Syrian opposition fighters were killed and five others wounded. A Syrian opposition spokesman said it took place Tuesday. The observatorys chief Rami Abdurrahman said helicopters struck as intense clashes were underway between Kurdish-led fighters and Turkey-backed forces in Tal Madiq and that 11 Syrian opposition fighters and five Kurdish fighters were killed. The Kurdish-led forces are now in control of the village about 16 kilometres from the highly prized Daesh-controlled town of Al Bab. A senior Kurdish commander however denied Syrian government bombings of the Turkey-backed fighters saying it was an attempted explanation for battlefield losses. They are trying to find a pretext for the loss. No aircraft were involved Mahmoud Barkhadan of the main Syria Kurdish militia the Peoples Protection Units told The Associated Press by telephone from the region. A spokesman for the Syrian fighting group Nour El Din El Zinki Yasser Al Youssef said the Kurdish-led forces attacked them while they were fighting Daesh militants in the area. Then Syrian government helicopters followed he said in a message. The complex terrain is a powder keg where confrontation among rival groups can break out anytime US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey. Ankara sent tanks troops and aircraft into northern Syria in August in an unprecedented incursion that it said was part of efforts to help Syrian opposition clear the border area of Daesh militants. But Ankara is also seeking to contain the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Daesh putting it at odds with its key ally the United States. Ankara sees Kurdish fighters in Syria as an extension of its outlawed Kurdish militants and designated as a terrorist organisation. Syrias military threatened last week to shoot down any Turkish warplane that enters Syrian air space after Turkish jets raided villages in northern Syria in an escalation of Ankaras offensive against Kurdish fighters. On Wednesday a statement attributed to the field commander of pro-government troops said Turkish advance under the pretext of fighting Daesh in northern and eastern Aleppo is an encroachment on the Syrian governments area of operations and would not be tolerated. The fall of Al Bab to Turkey-backed rebels would threaten the governments siege on the rebels in the city of Aleppo to the west. Meanwhile Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that Turkey is determined to push ahead with the offensive in northern Syria dubbed Operation Eurphrates Shield and capture Al Bab from Daesh militants. It would not be deterred by the bombing of Tal Madiq he said. Such attacks will not stop us from combatting Daesh Cavusoglu said. The Euphrates Shield operation will continue. The only goal of the Euphrates Shield operation is to clear Daesh from this area.,jordantimes,against,0.003442341,1,0.332185886,0.005163511,0.00172117,0.010327022,0.070567986,0.046471601,0.524153645,1

Assault on Manbij Kurdish-led forces are continuing their assault on the Islamic State group stronghold in northern Syria and are slowly advancing in the southern districts of Manbij and seized a number of silos on Wednesday. Coalition aircraft which are supporting the Kurdish-Arab forces on the ground have conducted 325 air raids around Manbij since 21 May including 29 strikes in the past four days. This has helped anti-IS fighters to gain 1000 kilometres of territory and a foothold in Manbij which is an important supply route for the jihadi force. ""The SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] has repeatedly defeated [IS] attempts to punch a hole through the cordon"" said Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Colonel Christopher Garver on Wednesday. He said this pressure is forcing IS to bring in new recruits to defend the city from the Kurdish-Arab force. ""Weve seen [IS] fighters leaving these previously defended towns to attempt to reinforce Manbij"" Garver said. ""As the pressure increases against [IS] in Manbij they are demonstrating more desperation to keep [IS] strategic crossroads open for access outside Syria.""

Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor.

1926479389,Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets,August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. ISIS militants launched an assault on a Kurdish-controlled town on Syrias border with Turkey on Saturday prompting air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. The attack was launched hours after a cessation of hostilities came into effect under a U.S.-Russian plan although the temporary truce does not apply to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front meaning the Syrian government Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to crush this attack and encircle the attackers although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from ISIS last year in an offensive backed by U.S.-led air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the militant capital. The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS struck the militant positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack 14 Turkish F-16s patrolled the Turkish-Syrian border on Friday Turkish military said. Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south Xelil said.

More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages.

He was hanged for ""violations committed by al-Nusra against the towns civilians"" according to a statement issued by the brigade. The FSAs special forces seventh division also issued a statement giving al-Nusra 48 hours to release those it took hostage nearly a week ago when it stormed its headquarters in the town of Ain Larouz. Those taken include the divisions commander and several fighters. The statement also called on al-Nusra to return all possessions it had taken and to abide by ""the law of God"" to prevent further bloodshed.

Local police officers learned that one of the bombers used a hand grenade to attack the police station from a viaduct before he detonated his explosive device at about 1330 on the viaduct which runs parallel to the police station. ""Previously the attacker whose identity was unknown attacked us. The terrorists outside the police station launched the attack from the viaduct. Police officers and the army unit together resisted and foiled the attack"" said Tarek a police officer. Afterward another bomber detonated his explosive device at the gate of the police station while a third bomber entered the police station and detonated his explosive device after being surrounded by police officers and an army unit. The Syrian regimes Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. Daesh said three of its fighters carried out an attack on a Damascus police station on Monday.

Tags Russia Syria Assad Deir az-Zour Islamic State SOHR At least 53 civilians including 21 children perished early Sunday morning when Russian air strikes hit ""residential buildings"" in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah in Deir az-Zour province on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The monitor had initially given a death toll of 34 civilians but the number spiked after more bodies were recovered. ""The toll increased after removing the debris in a long day of rescue operation"" Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP adding the strikes hit ""residential buildings"". At least 18 people were also wounded in the air raids he added. Russia is a close ally of Syrias President Bashar al-Assad and in September 2015 began a military intervention in support of his government that has gradually helped Damascus regain territory. Syrias Deir az-Zour is one of the last places IS jihadists hold territory in the country after being driven from their major strongholds including their one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqqa city. The oil-rich eastern province that borders Iraq was once almost completely under IS control but the jihadists now hold just nine percent of Deir az-Zour according to the Observatory. They have faced two separate offensives there one led by the regime with Russian backing and the other by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. Russia in drivers seat The latest strikes come as the United Nations tries to revitalise its flagging efforts to end a six-year civil war that has left Syria devastated and huge swathes of its population refugees. Syrias Deir az-Zour [click to enlarge] On Tuesday the eighth round of UN-brokered talks will kick off. They have achieved little so far but may be bolstered by the oppositions decision to bring a unified delegation to Geneva for the first time. For progress to happen rival sides will need to overcome the hurdle that has derailed past discussions the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He retains Moscows support but is loathed by much of Syrias rebel opposition who want him gone. Backed by Russias decisive military support Assads government has regained control of 55 percent of the country including major cities Damascus Aleppo Homs and Hama and around two-thirds of the population lives in regime-held areas. The rest is carved up between rebel factions jihadists and Kurdish forces. Some experts believe that Russia has clearly put itself in the drivers seat in recent months especially as US President Donald Trumps administration has pulled back from Syrian diplomatic front. Russia fellow regime ally Iran and rebel-backer Turkey have hosted negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana that led to the creation of four ""de-escalation zones"" which produced a drop in violence though deadly air strikes and battles continue in some areas. And this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a ""congress"" of Syrian regime and opposition figures a move backed by Ankara and Tehran. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

Tags Syria Aleppo civilians airstrikes At least 51 civilians including four children were killed in air raids and shelling attacks on Saturday in Syrias battleground city Aleppo and the neighbouring countryside. Syrian air force raids left 15 people dead in rebel-held areas in the east of Aleppo city. Nine civilians died in rebel shelling on the government-held west the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Another 27 people were killed in Syrian and Russian raids targeting a string of towns in the west of Aleppo province the Britain-based group added. In a major push last week to end a siege on opposition-held eastern Aleppo a coalition of rebels and Islamist fighters cut off the regimes own main access road on the southern edges of the city. Each side has used their newly acquired territory to bring food and other supplies into neighbourhoods of the city they control but the roads into rebel-held eastern Aleppo are still not safe for civilians to use. The fighting in Aleppo is reported to have killed at least 130 civilians since the end of July and has damaged hospitals clinics and the citys power and water networks.

The Daesh group claimed responsibility for the attack. Media reports said a truck loaded with large quantities of explosives blew up on the western edge of the town of Qamishli followed by an explosives-packed motorcycle a few minutes later in the same area. The blasts caused massive damage in the area and rescue teams were working to recover victims from under the rubble the SANA news agency said. This photo captured from the town of Nusaybin near the Turkish side of the border shows plume of smoke occurred after the explosion. (IHA Photo) Qamishli near the Turkish border is mainly controlled by PYD but Syrian regime forces are present and control the towns airport. Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars. Qamishli resident Suleiman Youssef a writer told The Associated Press by telephone that he heard the first explosion from few miles away. He said the blasts leveled several buildings to the ground and many people were trapped under the rubble. ""Most of the buildings at the scene of the explosion have been heavily damaged because of the strength of the blast"" he said. The Daesh group in a statement published by its affiliated Aamaq news agency said it carried out the attack in Qamishli describing it as a truck bombing that struck a complex of Kurdish offices. The terrorist group has carried out several bombings in Kurdish areas in Syria in the past. The PYD-dominated and U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces have been the main force fighting Daesh in northern Syria capturing significant territory from the terrorists over the past two years.

1924058046,Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 282016 QAMISHLI Syria A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,jordantimes,against,0.010917031,1,0.318777293,0.002183406,0,0.008733624,0.034934498,0.026200873,0.13043222,1

1926479140,Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre,Wednesday 24 August 2016 16:58 Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre. The Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to re-open the file of the Ghouta Massacre and refer it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine perpetrators of the massacre and bring them to justice so as to make sure such a heinous crime cannot be repeated. Reports by independent human rights groups indicated that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons 136 times since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2118 on September 27 2013 under which Assads declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the Assad regime would not have used banned weapons against Syrian civilians had it not been for its total disregard for the international community as well as its sense of protection and impunity. The Syrian Coalition denounced the extraordinary claims made by the Assad regimes UN representative Bashar Aljaafari who on Monday blamed France for the Ghouta Massacre that claimed the lives of over 1127 civilians a third of them women and children. The Coalition said Aljaafaris claims showed the utmost disregard for the victims of the Ghouta Massacre and are a desperate attempt to deny Assads responsibility for the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Following the massacre the Assad regime surrendered its cache of chemical weapons under the threat of UN sanctions and the use of force by the United States. Over the past three years the Assad regime has persistently denied responsibility for the Ghouta Massacre while seeking to blame opposition groups. However probes by the United Nations and international organizations produced a mass of evidence and facts pointing to the Assad regimes direct responsibility for the chemical attack on eastern Ghouta.

1923848168,US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor,"Tuesday 19 Jul 2016 US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor AFP Children were among at least 56 civilians killed in strikes by a US-led coalition early on Tuesday near a Syrian village held by the Islamic State (IS) group a monitor said. ""There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. ""If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be ""devastating"" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts. It said relief supplies had already been stockpiled in the city but ""further life-saving aid is needed urgently.""",ahram,against,0.006430868,1,0.266881029,0,0,0.01607717,0.057877814,0.035369775,0.583922416,1

Activists in Idlib province said that at least 135 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces on the province over the past three days. The bombardment targeted mainly public markets and residential buildings in a grave escalation in parallel with the ongoing brutal onslaught on Aleppo and its countryside. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Adnan Rahmoun condemned the escalating war crimes being committed by the Russian and Assad regime forces in Idlib and Aleppo. He lamented the lack of any response by the international community which is standing idly by as the Assad regime and Russia are committing these crimes using internationally banned weapons including vacuum bombs cluster bombs and white phosphorous. Rahmoun called upon the UN Security Council and the international community to put an end to the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime and its allies and to assume their responsibilities to protect civilians. He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment. Activists in rural Idlib said that three regime airstrikes hit a public market in the town of Sarmin on Tuesday killing 10 people including four children and two women. Russian jets launched multiple airstrikes on the main high street in the town of Maaret Alnouman killing eight people and wounding dozens more. Two more civilians were killed in regime airstrikes on the town of Maarrat Masrin. In total over 40 civilians were killed in the aerial bombardment that hit at least 11 towns and villages across Idlib on Tuesday. On Monday Russia and China vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for the imposition of a 7-day cease-fire in Aleppo so that humanitarian aid could reach the citys besieged eastern neighborhoods.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

Reuters also reported residents and rescue workers as saying that two dozen people were killed in the strikes and that Russian jets acting in support of the Bashar al Assads regime forces identified as such because they were flying in sorties at a high altitude may have been responsible.

Backed by Russian airstrikes the forces of Syrias President Bashar Assad notorious for their indiscriminate targeting of civilians are pressing a battle to retake IS-controlled areas in the eastern province of Deir az-Zour. A US-led international coalition has been providing air support to a Kurdish-Arab alliance also fighting the militants in its former northern bastion of Raqqa city and Deir az-Zour. September was the deadliest month for Syrians this year with the ongoing war killing at least 3000 people including 955 civilians.

The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against IS in Deir az-Zour and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former IS bastion of Raqqa. On Tuesday the Observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths in its strikes since it intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the Observatorys reporting as biased.

The report comes amid fierce clashes on the outskirts of Damascus between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant which is spearheading a major offensive in Iraq and rebels the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""ISIL executed eight men in Deir Hafer in the east of Aleppo province"" on Saturday because they belonged to rebel groups that had fought against the jihadists as well as Assads forces it said. ISIL then ""crucified them in the main square of the village where their bodies will remain for three days"" the Britain-based monitor said. Also in Aleppo province a ninth man was executed and crucified in Al-Bab town near the border with Turkey. ISIL first emerged in Syrias war in late spring last year and was initially welcomed by some Syrian rebels who believed its combat experience would help topple Assad. But subsequent jihadist abuses quickly turned the Syrian opposition including Islamists against ISIL. Rebels launched a major anti-ISIL offensive in January 2014 and have pushed them out of large swathes of Aleppo province and all of Idlib in the northwest. However ISIL remains firmly rooted in Raqa its northern Syrian headquarters and wields significant power in Deir Ezzor in the east near the border with Iraq. Activists say the groups Iraq offensive and capture of heavy weapons - some of them US-made - appears to have boosted its confidence in Syria.

The Army of Islam is a major component of the Islamic Front Syrias largest rebel coalition which has been fighting ISIL for months but such fighting in Damascus province is unprecedented. Regime soldiers and warplanes backed by Lebanons Shiite Hezbollah also pounded rebel positions near the capital with rockets and surface-to-surface missiles said the Local Coordination Committees activist network. Syrias war began as a peaceful protest movement in March 2011 demanding political change but became an armed insurgency when Assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown.

Tags Syria Assad Russia Eastern Ghouta Douma airstrikes More than 19 civilians were killed in Eastern Ghouta on Sunday as the Syrian regime stepped up its campaign to retake the last major opposition stronghold near the capital Damascus. At least 123 civilians have been killed in the besieged suburb by airstrikes and shelling since the Syrian regime and Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A witness told Reuters that there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning with warplanes heavily bombing the towns of Mesraba Harasta and Eastern Ghouta killing at least 19 civilians. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week that the intensifying bombardments were forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by Syrian regime forces since 2013 and no food aid convoys have entered the town of Douma since wheat flour rations in August. Civilians are eating rubbish fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days because of the food shortage the UN World Food Programme said this week. Nearly 174500 people trapped in the town of Douma since September have been forced to adopt emergency ""coping strategies"" the UN said. WFP expects the situation to further deteriorate in the coming weeks when the current food stock is expected to be depleted completely eroding the current household coping strategies. In the east of Syria Russian air strikes on Sunday killed 34 civilians among them 15 children in a village held by Islamic State in Deir az-Zour province an activist group said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

1918150046,Syria Kurdish Islamist violence kills 12 Al-Qaeda-linked fighters,Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution.

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

1924058067,Syria regime bombardment kills 4 schoolchildren in besieged enclave | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 012017 JISREEN Syria At least four schoolchildren were among eight people killed in Syrian regime shelling in Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday despite a ceasefire in the hunger-hit rebel enclave outside Damascus. The bombardment came as a fresh round of peace talks to end Syrias six-year war entered a second day in the Kazakh capital Astana. Government fire on the besieged region has been on the rise for the past week with the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor saying the latest shelling hit a school in the town of Jisreen. ""A shell fired by regime troops hit the entrance of a school in Jisreen just as children were leaving it killing five people including four schoolchildren"" observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. A medical source at the town hospital confirmed the death toll and said another 25 people were wounded. An AFP photographer at the medical facility saw the bodies of four children wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds. Several wounded children lay or sat in shock on hospital beds including one with severed legs. A man cried out after learning his son had died as others around him tried to comfort him. Blood-stained satchels Small blue school bags and a tiny pair of shoes lay in a corner drenched in blood. Outside the primary school children stared at the pools of blood staining the concrete ground. ""I was coming out of school and was about to turn into a side street when the shell hit. There were dead people wounded people"" one child told AFP. The observatory said regime bombardment on Tuesday also hit other areas of Eastern Ghouta where opposition fighters have been battling President Bashar Assads troops for six years. The regime on July 22 announced a ceasefire with rebels in the besieged area which has been included in a so-called de-escalation zone agreed by Turkey Russia and Iran. On Tuesday regime shelling on the Mesraba area also in Eastern Ghouta killed three civilians including one child the observatory said. An AFP journalist at a morgue saw rescue volunteers and young men slip the bodies of a father and his son into white plastic bags. May God avenge oppressors the mans brother cried. In the town of Harasta shelling also hit near a school as pupils were leaving it wounding 10 people including five children. On Sunday 11 civilians including a journalist for pro-opposition television were killed in Eastern Ghouta. Malnutrition The shelling comes as Eastern Ghouta where an estimated 400000 people live faces a mounting humanitarian crisis. Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa. They face twin offensives in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor from the regime and the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.",jordantimes,against,0.009456265,1,0.245862884,0.002364066,0,0.007092199,0.026004728,0.014184397,0.111815172,1

1923102873,Syrian regime airstrikes kill 22 civilians near Damascus,"Date of publication 3 April 2017 At least 22 civilians have been killed by Syrian regime airstrikes on the outskirts of Damascus on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Tags Syria Damascus Douma Regime Rebels Civilians Bashar al-Assad Airstrikes Syrian regime airstrikes on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 which has trapped over 300000 civilains and is targeted regularly by airstrikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. The World Health Organization last week demanded immediate humanitarian access to the area saying residents are in desperate need of medical attention. Time is running out for the people of East Ghouta. As health needs increase available resources are being depleted day by day. Our main goal now is to provide access to lifesaving care for thousands of vulnerable men women and children immediately said Elizabeth Hoff WHO Representative in Syria. All 3 public hospitals and 17 public health care centres in East Ghouta are nonfunctioning and inaccessible to the population the WHO said in a statement. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.
